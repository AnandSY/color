# Getting Started with Color

There's one page application that can show you monotone color palets with different shades (S and L)
The base idea is to get the hue from user and use that to create the pallet, 

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the application by simply starting it up:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
